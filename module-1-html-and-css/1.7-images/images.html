<!-- Images -->

<img src="tiger.png" alt="tiger" width="200">

<!-- the img attribute is self closing and does need a closing tag -->

<!-- all images should have an alt tag.  This is good practice for when
     the images does not load, or someone vision impaired if using your webpage 
-->

<!-- By only putting width the height will be automatically adjusted to scale 
     this should ideally be done in your css in the future
-->
