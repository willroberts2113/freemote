<h1>Why I joined Freemote</h1>

<div id="containter">
  <p>
    <span class="first-letter">I<span>'ve been on the quest to become a full-time developer for some time now.  I attended a web dev bootcamp this past year, but still find myself unsure of my ability to be a strong employee.  I decided recently to revisit freemote and use this to help reinforce my skillset so I can land my first full-time developer job or who knows, maybe even become a freelancer.  I am very curious about the shopify platform, and I am excited to learn more about it and the opportunities it can create.

    <span class="first-letter">W<span>hat originally got me started on this path was an unquenchable thirst to transition to a remote life so I can move outside of the United States.  I come from a military family and served in the military myself, and through those experiences I spent many years of my life living abroad.  I miss the adventure that living someplace unfamiliar brought to my life every single day.  I miss the great food, the hospitable people, and the complete absence of the weight existing in the western world brings.

    <span class="first-letter">I<span>'m trying my best to not dream too hard about where this might take me until it's the right time to do so.  When Aaron stated in a previous video that there is "a lot of code between you and that beach in Thailand" I really felt that.  My mission right now is to become the most productivite version of myself I have ever been.  I know if I can keep after it then this just might be the greatest decision I've ever made.
